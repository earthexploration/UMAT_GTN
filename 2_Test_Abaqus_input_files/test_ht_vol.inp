** RESTART: Save and reuse data and analysis results, This option is used to control the writing and reading of restart data
** WRITE: Include this parameter to specify that restart data are to be written during the analysis
**Optional parameter when you use written
**NUMBER INTERVAL: Set this parameter equal to the number of intervals during the step at which the *RESTART data are to be written
** TIME MARKS=YES (default) to write results at the exact times dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter
**TIME MARKS=NO to write the restart at the increment ending immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter
**When used with the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter in a co-simulation, the TIME MARKS parameter is always set to NO to write restart 
**information at the co-simulation target time after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.
